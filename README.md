📈 Stock Market Price Prediction using Regression
📌 Overview
Stock market price prediction is a crucial task in financial analytics, enabling traders and investors to make informed decisions. This project leverages Machine Learning (Regression models) to predict stock prices based on historical stock data. Using NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, and other indices, we analyze stock trends and forecast future price movements using Linear Regression.

🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Analyze historical stock price data and extract meaningful insights.

✅ Build a regression model to predict stock prices based on key indicators.

✅ Evaluate model performance using error metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

✅ Visualize stock trends using matplotlib and seaborn.

✅ Improve prediction accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

🛠️ Technologies Used
This project utilizes various Python libraries for data processing, machine learning, and visualization:

Python – For data processing and machine learning implementation.

Pandas & NumPy – For data manipulation and feature engineering.

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For visualizing stock trends and market movement.

Scikit-Learn – For implementing and evaluating the regression model.
